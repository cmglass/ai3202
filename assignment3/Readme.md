Hueristic 1: manhattan
  suppliedt heuristce, uses the distance below + distance laterially from node to target
  11 Results cost:130 59 nodes visited

Hueristic 2: manhattan
  custom huerisitc uses euclidean distance
  W1 Results cost:130 59 nodes visited same path 

Reulsts did not differ in iether world. I thought maybe the euclidean hueristic might decreas number of nodes visted.  I chose to use the euclidean distance because it seems more natural as it is the shortest distance in euclidean space
